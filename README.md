# Windows Platform Development Kit

The Windows Platform Development Kit (WPDK) enables applications based on the Storage Performance Deveopment Kit (SPDK) to build and run as native Windows executables by providing header files and a lightweight library that implement the required POSIX/Linux functionality.

The scope of the project is limited to supporting the Storage Performance Development Kit. It is not intended to be a generic Linux emulation library along the lines of cygwin. Functionality is mapped as closely as possible to existing Windows semantics with the minimum of emulation.
