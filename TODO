// HACK - to do list

Sanity checks for pthreads to make sure init/destroy calls are being used correctly
Move wpdk into source / header split and build a shared library (quicker debugging turnaround)

SPDK
enable static asserts
Fix nvme bit definitions and any initialisation (rename reserved to find)

afunix - only works on build 17063 onwards

Fix env inclusion for unit tests
Fix access to driver libs from DPDK that have no external symbols
Check if initialisation segment works with msvc as well as clang

Use #define __wrap_ for names to map to wpdk_ (or change wrap macro definition?)

Watch out for dllimport declarations - they override the static inline definitions and prevent the wrapper being private.

SetThreadDescription - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreaddescription

Overload fopen to map pathnames

Fix spaces / tabs in C files

Need a driver for local files (e.g aio equivalent)

Use SPDK_CONFIG_WPDK for some definitions rather than _WIN32

Add dllimport/export to header files

Add wpdk_ to all definitions in headers?

Closing one end of AF_UNIX should generate SIGPIPE signal.

internal/wpdk.h include file for common definitions and define_WPDK_BUILD_LIB_

Common array for fd state and flags in fd.c

Map paths to real temp dir

Document - trap all posix calls into the library so that one heap / list of files etc.

Check static for all file local functions.
