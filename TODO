// HACK - to do list

Sanity checks for pthreads to make sure init/destroy calls are being used correctly
Build a shared library (quicker debugging turnaround)

SPDK
enable static asserts
Fix nvme bit definitions and any initialisation (rename reserved to find)

afunix - only works on build 17063 onwards - verify and document

Fix env inclusion for unit tests
Check if initialisation segment works with msvc as well as clang

Use #define __wrap_ for names to map to wpdk_ (or change wrap macro definition?)

Watch out for dllimport declarations - they override the static inline definitions and prevent the wrapper being private.

SetThreadDescription - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreaddescription

Use SPDK_CONFIG_WPDK for some definitions rather than _WIN32

Add dllimport/export to header files

Closing one end of AF_UNIX should generate SIGPIPE signal.

Common array for fd state and flags in fd.c

Map paths to real temp dir

Document - trap all posix calls into the library so that one heap / list of files etc.

Check static for all file local functions.

epoll needs to define OUT option as well.

Investigate impact of thread local storage https://github.com/PlushBeaver/tlstest

pthreads - defer initialisation of mutex and condition variable until later (spinlock)

Fix for 32-bit builds

libiscsi - include it
libiscsi includes md5 code

Add log message handling - also add way for unit tests to tell if called.

Review the use of restrict.
