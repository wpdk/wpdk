# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. It is expected that the process will be modelled on the [SPDK Development Guidelines](https://spdk.io/development/). In these initial stages of the project, please email the [maintainers](https://github.com/wpdk/wpdk/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) directly.

Please join the [SPDK community](https://spdk.io/community) and tell us how you are using SPDK on Windows. For real-time discussions, the SPDK Slack contains a [Windows channel](https://spdk-team.slack.com/archives/C01Q700GPGU).
